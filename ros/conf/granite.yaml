# CALIBRATION PARAMETERS
#
# The calibration node is responsible for estimating and maintaining the
# fixed transforms from the world to lighthouse, and from the set of
# rigidly connected trackers to what we consider to be the body frame. It
# does so by framing the localization problem as least-square error
# minimization over a connected graph
#
# Our approach uses only light measurements and pose corrections to solve
# for the lighthouse positions in the world frame and the transforms of
# the trackers (mechanical frame) with respect to the body frame..
#
# If the calibration procedure works as expected, we'll have a set of
# lighthouse -> world and tracker -> tracker/body transforms. We'll then
# write these to a calibration file, which is written to the default ROS
# working directory (~/.ros) and persisted across restarts.

# GENERAL OPTIONS

# Parent frame is the "world" frame, and child frame is typically "body",
# but these may vary if you are tracking multiple rigid bodies
frames:
  parent:           "world"
  child:            "body"

# Thresholds used to reject measurements
thresholds:
  count:            4          # Min pulses/sweep to add to solver
  angle:            60.0       # Threshold on angle (in degres)
  duration:         1.0        # Threshod on duration (in microsecs)
  correction:       0.01       # 10ms threshold on mapped time

# Publish rviz markers for the sensors
visualize:          true
