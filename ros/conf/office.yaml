# CALIBRATION PARAMETERS
#
# The calibration node is responsible for estimating and maintaining the
# fixed transforms from the world to lighthouse, and from the set of
# rigidly connected trackers to what we consider to be the body frame. It
# does so by framing the localization problem as least-square error
# minimization over a connected graph
#
# Our approach uses only light measurements and pose corrections to solve
# for the lighthouse positions in the world frame and the transforms of
# the trackers (mechanical frame) with respect to the body frame..
#
# If the calibration procedure works as expected, we'll have a set of
# lighthouse -> world and tracker -> tracker/body transforms. We'll then
# write these to a calibration file, which is written to the default ROS
# working directory (~/.ros) and persisted across restarts.

# GENERAL OPTIONS

# Parent frame is the "world" frame, and child frame is typically "truth",
# and estimate is usally "body"
frames:
  world:            "world"
  vive:             "vive"
  truth:            "truth"
  body:             "body"

# Thresholds used to reject measurements
thresholds:
  count:            1          # Min pulses/sweep to add to solver
  angle:            60.0       # Threshold on angle (in degres)
